---LP.local---Prototype---
What Steve told me:
This connects to the firewall/domain/server.
In change adapter options, go to the configuration for the LP.local network.
Once in the configuration, enable the static IP option.
Make host machine's IP Address "192.168.150.254".
Make the host machine's subnet mask "255.255.255.0".

This might be this static ip and subnet mask cos in the production for kaliexternal, 
I needed to create a new host-only network, Steve helped me do this and said I needed the ip address "192.168.150.254" for the DMZ Server VM.

I'm not sure if the DMZ Server effects the LP.local server, and when I patch into the firewall.

------I also need to install/copy what is in the main branch into the powershell (run as Administrator) on my Production Client-------------DONE
------I'm currently up to 11.1.6 Control script stages via Mutex interface and 11.1.7 Make a copy of test01 called test02 and edit-------

The url to go to http://192.168.100.200:443, is actually 127.0.0.1:443.
I have gone onto this website/local host(me), and typed in offsec as my login and password.

kalisiem.lp.local:443 - is the KaliSIEM [address] but it didn't work.

DURING THIS LESSON I HAVE COMPLETED 11.1.6, 11.1.7 AND INSTALLED THE CODE FROM THE MAIN BRANCH, ONTO MY CLIENT'S POWERSHELL (RAN AS ADMINISTRATOR).
I have completed 11.1.7, now I'm up to 11.2 Enumeration with NMAP scans.

----Kaliexternal----
My Kaliexternal had UI issues that caused my windows to be frozen in place and have missing buttons.
Writing the command 'xfwm4' made the desktop environment restart, which in effect has reset everything back to normal and in working order.
I also had an issue with the VirtualBox and Guest Additions, I had to reinstall the linux headers directly.
The commands I used in Kali Purple were the following (to fix the VirtualBox Guest Additions and the headers):

uname -r (check your current kernel version)
sudo apt-get update 
sudo apt-get -y dist-upgrade 
reboot 
uname -r (check your new kernel version)

sudo apt-get -y install linux-headers-$(uname -r)

cd /media/cdrom0/
sudo sh VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
