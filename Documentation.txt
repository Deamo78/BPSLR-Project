---Commands used to Install VBox - Guest Additions on KaliPurple Prod------------------
1. Copy and paste the cdrom0 - Thunar disc contents to the DOWNLOADS folder.
2. Open terminal and type 'cd Downloads', then it is in the directory.
3. Type in 'chmod 755 VBoxLinuxAdditions.run' to overwrite permissions.
4. Type the 'sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run' command to execute the file.
5. Follow the commands to install (type 'y' when prompt appears).
6. Restart the VM to confirm and start the VBox - Guest Additions.
7. You should now have Guest Additions on your VM.


---LP.local---Prototype---
What Steve told me:
This connects to the firewall/domain/server.
In change adapter options, go to the configuration for the LP.local network.
Once in the configuration, enable the static IP option.
Make host machine's IP Address "192.168.150.254".
Make the host machine's subnet mask "255.255.255.0".

This might be this static ip and subnet mask cos in the production for kaliexternal, 
I needed to create a new host-only network, Steve helped me do this and said I needed the ip address "192.168.150.254" for the DMZ Server VM.

I'm not sure if the DMZ Server effects the LP.local server, and when I patch into the firewall.

------I also need to install/copy what is in the main branch into the powershell (run as Administrator) on my Production Client-------------DONE
------I'm currently up to 11.1.6 Control script stages via Mutex interface and 11.1.7 Make a copy of test01 called test02 and edit-------

The url to go to http://192.168.100.200:443, is actually 127.0.0.1:443.
I have gone onto this website/local host(me), and typed in offsec as my login and password.

kalisiem.lp.local:443 - is the KaliSIEM [address] but it didn't work.

DURING THIS LESSON I HAVE COMPLETED 11.1.6, 11.1.7 AND INSTALLED THE CODE FROM THE MAIN BRANCH, ONTO MY CLIENT'S POWERSHELL (RAN AS ADMINISTRATOR).
I have completed 11.1.7, now I'm up to 11.2 Enumeration with NMAP scans.

----Kaliexternal----
My Kaliexternal had UI issues that caused my windows to be frozen in place and have missing buttons.
Writing the command 'xfwm4' made the desktop environment restart, which in effect has reset everything back to normal and in working order.
I also had an issue with the VirtualBox and Guest Additions, I had to reinstall the linux headers directly.
The commands I used in Kali Purple were the following (to fix the VirtualBox Guest Additions and the headers):

uname -r (check your current kernel version)
sudo apt-get update 
sudo apt-get -y dist-upgrade 
reboot 
uname -r (check your new kernel version)

sudo apt-get -y install linux-headers-$(uname -r)

cd /media/cdrom0/
sudo sh VBoxLinuxAdditions.run

###GREENBONE###
I'm up to fixing the error [msg] in Greenbone, when trying to scan for 11.3. It should work cos we have downloaded the port list - but isn't working.
To do: Research what is happening and how to fix it. Search up the Error msg, what does it mean.
Error msg - 'Failed to find port_list '33d0cd82-57c6-11e1-8ed1-406186ea4fc5'.

##########RED TEAM-KALI EXTERNAL ACTIVITIES###########
To do:
Download vulnerability scanners
Try and use the red team tools like DoS, dsniff and arp-scan.

Steve helped me get internet connection on my KaliExternal Prod - PC VM, my gateway was wrong, but also when I ping the gateway after the changes were made and the vm had rebooted I could ping 8.8.8.8 and 192.168.108.1. 
Steve also helped me with recovering my Client Prod, made imported/made a new VM and imported the .vdi from the Client Prod in place of the broken one (remove the broken one first, then added the directory of the NEW vm and the original .vdi that didn't work/boot.)

I'm trying the nmap ones again from the ICT project GitHub, as Luke installed nmap for me.

Types of red team attacks I've done so far:
NIKTO, NMAP, ZAP, Hydra, Arp-scan/arp-poisoning (Steve said this was for Internal network, this somehow worked for the External network, Steve [and I] thought this was interesting - I have put my results on the CSOC Presentation as screenshots.) 
During or afer the minute meeting today 25/06/2024, Steve said that he was happy with the work I've done and he doesn't need to see the fixed hydra attack.

I can't get the DSniff tool to work, so I will leave that red team attack and move on with something else.
Steve has said I have done a lot of red team attacks already, Steve doesn't mind how many are done.

I chatted to Isaac's group, and they said they are not doing the vulnerability scanner cos it's too difficult to set up, so they just did the red team attacks like hydra etc.

Cos I was accidentally on the Internal network, I have to change everything to the External network and configure everything properly for example, the Hydra attack etc. It worked before cos I was configured to the Internal network, when I should've been on the External network.
