---LP.local---Prototype---
What Steve told me:
This connects to the firewall/domain/server.
In change adapter options, go to the configuration for the LP.local network.
Once in the configuration, enable the static IP option.
Make host machine's IP Address "192.168.150.254".
Make the host machine's subnet mask "255.255.255.0".

This might be this static ip and subnet mask cos in the production for kaliexternal, 
I needed to create a new host-only network, Steve helped me do this and said I needed the ip address "192.168.150.254" for the DMZ Server VM.

I'm not sure if the DMZ Server effects the LP.local server, and when I patch into the firewall.

------I also need to install/copy what is in the main branch into the powershell (run as Administrator) on my Production Client-------------DONE
------I'm currently up to 11.1.6 Control script stages via Mutex interface and 11.1.7 Make a copy of test01 called test02 and edit-------

DURING THIS LESSON I HAVE COMPLETED 11.1.6 AND INSTALLED THE CODE FROM THE MAIN BRANCH, ONTO MY CLIENT'S POWERSHELL (RAN AS ADMINISTRATOR).
NOW I'M UP TO 11.1.7.

The url to go to http://192.168.100.200:443, is actually 127.0.0.1:443.
I have gone onto this website/local host(me), and typed in offsec as my login and password.

kalisiem.lp.local:443 - is the KaliSIEM [address] but it didn't work.
