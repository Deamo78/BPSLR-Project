---LP.local---Prototype---
What Steve told me:
This connects to the firewall/domain/server.
In change adapter options, go to the configuration for the LP.local network.
Once in the configuration, enable the static IP option.
Make host machine's IP Address "192.168.150.254".
Make the host machine's subnet mask "255.255.255.0".

This might be this static ip and subnet mask cos in the production for kaliexternal, 
I needed to create a new host-only network, Steve helped me do this and said I needed the ip address "192.168.150.254" for the DMZ Server VM.

I'm not sure if the DMZ Server effects the LP.local server, and when I patch into the firewall.
